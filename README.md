## Features

### 4-Role Permission System
| Role | Portal | Capabilities |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Admin** | `/admin` | Creates teams, generates invite codes (coach + player + parent), manages members, schedule, roles, contacts, facilities, billing, knowledge base, AI insights, video scouting, coach engagement, player development |
| **Coach** | `/` | AI chat (8 agents), drills (assign + track), plays (create + share), practice planning, reports, evaluations, team data, schedule requests, knowledge base, video scouting, messaging |
| **Player** | `/player` | AI chat (5 agents), view schedule, assigned drills (video proof upload), shared plays, personal reports, team roster, leaderboard, video feed, messaging |
| **Parent** | `/parent` | View child info, team info, schedule, payments, video feed, messaging, carpool coordination |

Admin creates team → sends coach invite code → coach joins → coach gives player/parent invite codes → player/parent joins.

### AI Chat — 13 Specialist Agents

#### 8 Coach Agents
Questions are automatically routed to the most relevant agent by keyword matching (Hebrew + English).

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Assistant Coach | Practice planning, team management |
| Team Manager | Scheduling, logistics, facilities, billing, **all team data** |
| The Tactician | Game strategy, plays, X's & O's |
| Skills Coach | Drills, technique, skill development (13+) |
| Sports Nutritionist | Nutrition, diet, recovery |
| Strength & Conditioning | Workouts, injury prevention |
| The Analyst | Statistics, performance data, billing analysis |
| Youth Coach | Ages 5-12, fun-based development |

#### 5 Player Agents
| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Shooting Coach | Shooting form, shot selection, range development |
| Dribbling Coach | Ball handling, crossovers, moves, control |
| Passing Coach | Passing technique, court vision, playmaking |
| Fitness Coach | Strength, conditioning, agility, injury prevention |
| Nutritionist | Diet, hydration, recovery food, meal planning |

### AI Data Integration (3-Tier Context)
Every AI chat message is enriched with real data:
1. **Tier 1 — Team/Player Summary** (always present): roster, record, upcoming events, facilities
2. **Tier 2 — On-Demand Data** (keyword-triggered): detailed roster, events, drills, plays, practices, game reports, attendance stats, player reports, billing
3. **Tier 3 — RAG Knowledge** (semantic search): coaching documents from knowledge base

### Play Creator
SVG-based basketball court with drag-and-drop players, 6 action types (pass, dribble, cut, screen, handoff, shot), animation playback with bezier curves, formation templates (6 offense + 3 defense), team sharing, and shareable URLs.

### AI Drill Generator & Assignment System
Select category + difficulty + optional focus — GPT-4o generates a complete drill. Coaches assign drills to players, players upload video proof, coaches review and approve/reject with feedback.

### AI Practice Planner
Describe session focus and duration — AI builds a structured practice with warmup, drills, scrimmage, and cooldown segments.

### Reports & Evaluations
- **Attendance tracking** — per-event per-player with streaks and stats
- **Game reports** — score, standouts, areas to improve, auto-linked to team events
- **AI player assessments** — GPT-4o generates strengths/weaknesses/recommendations
- **Player evaluations** — 9-category rating system (1-10 scale), admin-requested

### Video Room & Scouting
Cloudinary-powered video hosting with:
- Direct browser-to-cloud upload, adaptive HLS streaming, CDN delivery
- Video clip creation with 13 basketball action tags
- Interactive telestrator (freehand, arrow, circle, text) with JSON stroke persistence
- Player tagging with notifications
- Player video feed (mobile-first, "Watched" confirmation)
- Parent video feed (shared clips only)
- Storage quota management (50GB/team default) with TTL auto-cleanup

### Knowledge Base (RAG)
3-tier knowledge system: System (global) → Club (admin) → Coach (personal)
- Upload PDF/DOCX/TXT → paragraph-aware chunking → OpenAI embeddings → ChromaDB vector store
- Semantic search integrated into all AI agents and content generation
- 16 categories mapped per agent type

### Billing & Payments
- Payment plans with monthly installments per player
- One-time charges (registration, equipment, etc.)
- Admin: create plans, generate charges, confirm payments, send reminders
- Parent: view charges, mark as paid (player-centric: both parents see same charges)
- Auto-overdue detection via background task

### Universal Messaging
- Admin/Coach → any role communication
- Team-based broadcast, individual targeting, scheduled messages
- Unread counts in navigation badge
- Role-aware targeting (all_club, all_coaches, team, individual, etc.)

### Carpool Coordination
- **Event-based rides** — parents offer/join rides to specific events
- **Standing carpools** — recurring carpool groups with event sign-ups
- Direction support (to event, from event, or both)

### AI Insights (Admin)
- **Financial Agent** — billing analysis, payment reminders, weekly reports
- **Professional Agent** — player performance, team metrics, coach engagement scoring
- Auto-generated weekly reports via background tasks

### Admin Schedule Management
Admin creates team events (single or recurring series). Coaches submit schedule requests that admins can approve or reject. Home/away game support with departure time and venue address. Calendar widget with monthly navigation.

### Team Management
Full CRUD for players (roster, positions, contacts, attendance streaks), events (calendar with recurring), and facilities (venues).

### Admin Roles & Contacts
Admin role management (5 default Hebrew roles + custom), contacts directory across all teams with search and filtering.

### Coach Engagement Analytics
5-category scoring (reports, communication, training, attendance, AI usage) with 90-day activity timeline.
